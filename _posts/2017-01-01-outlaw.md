# Guide to Outlaw Rogue

Welcome to the guide for Outlaw Rogue in 8.0.1. If you're looking for a good
introduction to playing Outlaw in in Battle for Azeroth, you've come
to the right place.

I'll make a note of any changes to the guide and the date it was updated here if
you want to come back in the future to check for changes.

**Last updated: Friday, 27th july 2018 -BFA upgrades**

Please note things are subject to change in the early days of patch 8.0 when
things are discovered, hot fixes happen and balance is under way.

## Introduction

Outlaw has lost some of its pirate side of things when it comes to theme. But
mechanically Outlaw still plays much like it did in legion. It still is the one
true burst cleave spec rogue has. In general the spec was slowed and normalized
slightly when it comes to energy regeneration, so it plays smoother.

## Talents

Outlaw talents are much closer to eachother with 8.0.1 and the rework to our
talent tree. These may be the best talents, but picking the "wrong" one is not
as much of a damage loss as it has been in the past. This also means minor changes
through tier or azerite can push a talent to being better than its counterparts.

These talents are subject to change due to discoveries and hot fixes. This is
only a simple outline for now.

### Single Target

- Level 15: Quick Draw
- Level 30: Optional
- Level 45: Vigor or Marked for death<sup>1</sup>
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Alacrity
- Level 100: Blade Rush

### Multi Target

- Level 15: Quick Draw
- Level 30: Optional
- Level 45: Vigor or Marked for death<sup>1</sup>
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Alacrity
- Level 100: Blade Rush

1: The choice here depends on the content you are doing as well as your
gear. Use Vigor, if you cannot take advantage of continuous resets on
Marked for Death. Also great haste levels might make Marked for Death
better than vigor even without constant resets.

## Gearing &amp; Stats

Gearing in Battle for Azeroth should be more straight forward. Blizzard is
trying to make item level always be the decidint factor and limit your ways
of obtaining loot by having only personal loot, and not allowing trading of
all pieces.  We still have our prefered stats, but they should not be as
decicive as in legion.

"Stat Weights," is a term you might have heard many times. What is actually
being discussed, is **scale factors**, because they usually change the moment
you change a piece of equipment. This is why we recommend that you sim your
character to compare items rather than relying on **weights**.

For stats you should be aiming for the following:

### Single Target

- Agility
- Haste
- Versatility
- Critical Strike
- Mastery

### Multi Target

- Agility
- Haste
- Versatility
- Critical Strike
- Mastery

For your food buff while raiding you should use the primary stat Feast. If
you're unable to use a Feast, the food for the secondary stat that you're scale
factors says is highest.

For potions you should use Potion of the Prolonged Power in all situations.

For your flask you should always use Flask of the Seventh Demon.

### Traits

Rough order.

### Single Target

- Deadshot, BTE increases the damage of your next pistol shot.
- Ace Up Your Sleeve, Between the eyes deals addition damage and a has chance to refund 4 combo points.
- Storm of Steel, When sinister strike strikes an additional time your next dispatch will deal additional damage.
- Snake Eyes Roll, roll the bones increases the damage of your next 5 Sinister strikes.
- Paradise lost, When roll the bones only grants 1 buff gain agility for the duration of the roll.
- Brigand's Blitz, Adrenaline rush increases your haste every second stacking up to 10 times for the duration of adrenaline rush.

### Multi Target

- Deadshot, BTE increases the damage of your next pistol shot.
- Ace Up Your Sleeve, Between the eyes deals addition damage and a has chance to refund 4 combo points.
- Storm of Steel, When sinister strike strikes an additional time your next dispatch will deal additional damage.
- Snake Eyes Roll, roll the bones increases the damage of your next 5 Sinister strikes.
- Paradise lost, When roll the bones only grants 1 buff gain agility for the duration of the roll.
- Brigand's Blitz, Adrenaline rush increases your haste every second stacking up to 10 times for the duration of adrenaline rush.

**When in doubt, run a simulation for your character and the item(s) in
question.**

## Rotation

### Pre-Pull

- 18 seconds on the pull timer, Marked for Death when talented
- 2 seconds on the pull timer, use Roll the bones If you casted marked for death
- 1 second on the pull timer, Adrenaline rush, Potion and Etealth

### Pull

- Ambush
- Sinister Strike
- Blade Rush

### CoolDowns

- Killing spree on cool down at low energy level
- Adrenaline Rush on cool down at not capped energy
- Blade Rush on cooldown at not capped energy
- Vanish on cooldown at 60+ energy
- Marked for Death on cool down at low combo points unless you can quickly reset
it via a dying mob.

### At 5 Combo Points<sup>2</sup>

- Roll the Bones, currently optimal reroll logic is to reroll until you get a single
Ruthless Precicion, Grand Melee or a combination of two or more of any of the buffs.<sup>3</sup>
- Between the Eyes, if you have Ruthless Precision up
- Run Through

2 and 3: More details about this can be found in the
[FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions).

### Building combo points

- Ambush
- Sinister Strike

### Cleave

- Active Blade flurry and continue as normal
- Be sure to save a charge of blade flurry for Killing spree/Blade Rush if talented.

## AddOns &amp; Macros

There isn't really any hard requirements for AddOns you should use. You should
look into using Weak Auras and/or an energy bar AddOn.

### Weak Auras

You can find a number of Weak Auras available on [wago.io](https://wago.io).

### Macros

There are not any required Outlaw macros. A generally accepted beneficial one
is the mouseover Marked for Death macro. It's useful if a ranged target is about
to die, and you want the Combo points and the reset.

Mouse over Marked for Death:

    /cast [@mouseover] Marked for Death

## Frequently Asked Questions

### You did not mention when to use finishers

Base level rule is that you finish at maximum combo points. This all changes when
you have Quick Draw talented. If you have Broadside up, you reduce that amount by
one. Opportunity reduces that by another one. So if you are playing with Quick
Draw and you have Broadside up and you proc Opportunity, you finish at 3 combo
points.

### Rolling Dice in 7.2.5

The benefits of rerolling do not change no matter how bad your luck has been so
far. This means there is no point where rerolling becomes not worth it. Always
reroll until you get the buffs required.

### When do we Pistol Shot?

We no longer need to cast pistol shot at the right times since it now costs energy
and does a fair amount of damage. Simply cast it whenever you would not overcap
combo points.
