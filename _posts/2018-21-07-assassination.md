# Guide to Assassination Rogue

Welcome to the guide for Assassination Rogue in 8.0. If you're looking for a
good introduction to playing Assassination in Battle for Azeroth, you've come
to the right place.

I'll make a note of any changes to the guide and the date it was updated here if
you want to come back in the future to check for changes.

**Last updated: Friday, 27th july 2018 -Poison Bombing no more**

Please note things are subject to change in the early days of patch 8.0 when
things are discovered, hot fixes happen and balance is under way.

## Introduction

Assassination is seen as the go to easy mode spec among all classes. This is
due to the low entry level and fairly straight forward rotation. We pack a lot
of single target damage with our basic tool kit. In addition to our single target
we have some consistent cleave potential with our DoT orientated kit and talents
to support that. Assassination still remains a lot of its similarities from
legion due to minimal changes moving from expansion to expansion.

## Talents

Assassination talents are greatly situational and can be swapped a lot. There
are a lot of different combinations yielding results close to each other.
You may choose one over another based on preference, simulation result or
a different encounter you are facing.

These talents are subject to change due to discoveries and hot fixes. This is
only a simple outline for now.

### Single Target

- Level 15: Master Poisoner or Elaborate Planning or Blindside
- Level 30: Subterfuge or Master Assassin
- Level 45: Vigor
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Toxic Blade
- Level 100: Poison Bomb

### Multi Target

- Level 15: Master Poisoner or Elaborate Planning
- Level 30: Nightstalker or Subterfuge
- Level 45: Vigor or Deeper Stratagem or Marked for Death
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Toxic Blade
- Level 100: Criomson Tempest

You should always run a simulation of your character to check which talents are
best for you.

## Gearing &amp; Stats

Gearing in Battle for Azeroth should be more straight forward. Blizzard is
trying to make item level always be the decidint factor and limit your ways
of obtaining loot by having only personal loot, and not allowing trading of
all pieces.  We still have our prefered stats, but they should not be as
decicive as in legion.

"Stat Weights," is a term you might have heard many times. What is actually
being discussed, is **scale factors**, because they usually change the moment
you change a piece of equipment. This is why we recommend that you sim your
character to compare items rather than relying on **weights**.

For stats you should be aiming for the following:

### Single Target

- Agility
- Haste
- Critical Strike
- Mastery
- Versatility

### Multi Target

- Agility
- Haste until a point
- Critical Strike
- Mastery
- Versatility
- Haste after the point

For your food buff while raiding you should use the primary stat Feast. If
you're unable to use a Feast, the food for the secondary stat that you're scale
factors says is highest.

For potions you should use Potion of the Prolonged Power in all situations.

For your flask you should always use Flask of the Seventh Demon.

### Traits

Rough order.
