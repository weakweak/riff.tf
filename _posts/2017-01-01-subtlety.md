# Guide to Subtlety Rogue

Welcome to the guide for Subtlety Rogue in 8.0. If you're looking for a good
introduction to playing Subtlety in Battle for Azeroth, you've come
to the right place.

I'll make a note of any changes to the guide and the date it was updated here if
you want to come back in the future to check for changes.

**Last updated: Friday, 27th july 2018 -The most secret of techniques**

Please note things are subject to change in the early days of patch 8.0 when
things are discovered, hot fixes happen and balance is under way.

<div id="toc"></div>

## Introduction

Subtlety is largely the same as it was in legion. The spec mainly lost some speed
along the artifact weapon. It still offers great ability to feed multiple enemies
into a priority target. 

## Talents

Subtlety talents focus on two builds depending on the amount of targets.
More dancing for single target and more impactful dancing for AoE.

These talents are subject to change due to discoveries and hot fixes. This is
only a simple outline for now.

### Single Target

- Level 15: Find Weakness
- Level 30: Shadow Focus
- Level 45: Marked for Death
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Enveloping Shadows
- Level 100: Master of Shadows

### Multi Target

- Level 15: Find Weakness
- Level 30: Shadow Focus
- Level 45: Deeper Stratagem
- Level 60: Optional
- Level 75: Optional
- Level 90: Dark Shadow
- Level 100: Secret Technique

You should always run a simulation of your character to check which talents are
best for you.

## Gearing &amp; Stats

Gearing in Battle for Azeroth should be more straight forward. Blizzard is
trying to make item level always be the decidint factor and limit your ways
of obtaining loot by having only personal loot, and not allowing trading of
all pieces.  We still have our prefered stats, but they should not be as
decicive as in legion.

"Stat Weights," is a term you might have heard many times. What is actually
being discussed, is **scale factors**, because they usually change the moment
you change a piece of equipment. This is why we recommend that you sim your
character to compare items rather than relying on **weights**.

For stats you should be aiming for the following:

### Single Target

- Agility
- Critical Strike
- Mastery
- Haste
- Versatility

### Multi Target

- Agility
- Mastery
- Critical Strike
- Versatility
- Haste 

For your food buff while raiding you should use the primary stat Feast. If
you're unable to use a Feast, the food for the secondary stat that you're scale
factors says is highest.

For potions you should use Potion of the Prolonged Power in all situations.

For your flask you should always use Flask of the Seventh Demon.

### Traits

Rough order.

### Single Target

- Blade In The Shadows Shadowstrike increases the damage your Shadowstrike deals for 1 min, stacking up to 10 times.
- Inevitability Backstab and Shadowstrike deal an additional damage and extend the duration of your Symbols of Death by 1 sec.

- Perforate Backstabbing an enemy from behind increases the damage of Backstab for 12 sec, stacking up to 3 times.
- Sharpened Blades Your autoattacks increase the damage of your next Shuriken Toss or Poisoned Knife by, stacking up to 40 times.
- The First Dance Shadow Dance grants additional critical strike rating to the first Eviscerate, Shadowstrike, or Shuriken Storm
used during it.

### Multi Target

- Blade In The Shadows Shadowstrike increases the damage your Shadowstrike deals for 1 min, stacking up to 10 times.
- Inevitability Backstab and Shadowstrike deal an additional damage and extend the duration of your Symbols of Death by 1 sec.
- Night's Vengeance Nightblade increases the damage of your next Eviscerate within 8 sec.
- Perforate Backstabbing an enemy from behind increases the damage of Backstab for 12 sec, stacking up to 3 times.
- Sharpened Blades Your autoattacks increase the damage of your next Shuriken Toss or Poisoned Knife by, stacking up to 40 times.
- The First Dance Shadow Dance grants additional critical strike rating to the first Eviscerate, Shadowstrike, or Shuriken Storm

**When in doubt, run a simulation for your character and the item(s) in
question.**
